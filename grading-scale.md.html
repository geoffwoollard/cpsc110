Superior grasp of subject matter with sound and penetrating critical evaluations, which identify assumptions of those they study as well as their own; ; mastery of an extensive knowledge base.
    A            |85-89                  |4.0         | Excellent                  | Clear evidence of original thinking, of analytic and synthetic ability; Strong grasp of subject matter with sound critical evaluations; evidence of broad knowledge base.
    A-           |80-84                  |3.67        | Very, very good           | Strong grasp of subject matter and sound critical assessments with appreciation for the larger context.
    **B range:**                        | Good: Student shows critical capacity and analytic ability, understanding of relevant issues, familiarity with the literature.
    B+           |76-79                  |3.33        | Very good           | Good critical capacity and analytic ability; reasonable understanding of relevant issues; good evidence of familiarity with literature.
    B           |72-75                  |3.0        | Good           | Solid critical capacity and analytic ability; reasonable understanding of relevant issues; good evidence of familiarity with literature.
    B-           |68-71                  |2.67        | Satisfactory           | Adequate critical capacity and analytic ability; reasonable understanding of relevant issues; evidence of familiarity with literature.
    **C range:**                        | Acceptable to minimum.
    C+           |64-67                  |2.33        | Acceptable           | Basic critical capacity and analytic ability; some understanding of relevant issues; some evidence of familiarity with literature.
