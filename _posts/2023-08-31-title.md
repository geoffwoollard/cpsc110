Calendar Description
======================================================================================
This course offers fundamental program and computation structures. The course takes you through introductory programming skills exploring computation as a tool for information processing, simulation and modeling, and interacting with the world.

Course Description
======================================================================================
An introduction to computer programming made for students with very little or no programming knowledge. The fundamental concepts and terminology of computing science will be taught so that the students can acquire elementary skills for programming in Python. This knowledge can be applied in diverse fields and applications of computing science.

Course Pre-requisite(s):
: - Grade 12 Math

Learning Outcomes
======================================================================================
* Describe fundamental concepts pertaining to computing science:
  * Computer science
  * Problem solving
  * Algorithms
  * Decomposition
  * Abstraction
  * Computer program
  * Programming language
  * History of computers/computation

Required Texts & Resources
======================================================================================
Textbooks:
: - *_TP_*: Elkner et al., [_Think Python - How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, 2nd Edition_](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)
  - *_PS_*: Miller et al., [_Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python_](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)

Hardware: 
: - (Recommended) A personal laptop running a modern web browser.

Course Requirements:
======================================================================================
No prior programming experience is required. Basic computer literacy is expected including keyboarding skills, file management and use of a web browser.

Grade Distribution:
======================================================================================


    Component                |  Percentage
   --------------------------|-------------------
    Quizzes                  | 10%
    Labs                     | 20%
    Assignments              | 20%
    Exam 1                   | 20%
    Exam 2 (final)           | 20%
    In-class participation   | 10%

Course Policies:
======================================================================================
It is the responsibility of every student to read and understand the College Policies. The College Policies on Academic Honesty, Academic Standing, Academic Concession, Final Exam , Grading Practices, Student Conduct, Technology Usage, and more can be found here: [http://corpuschristi.ca/about-us/academic-policies](https://corpuschristi.ca/current-students/#Policies)

Attendance / Participation:
======================================================================================
As per the college Final Exam policy, students who miss more than 25% of course lectures may be barred from writing the final exam.

Accomodations:
======================================================================================
Students with documented disabilities who may require accommodations must contact the UBC Centre for Accessibility (https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-for-accessibility) as soon as possible.

Assignments:
======================================================================================
To satisfy the requirements of this course, students will carry out weekly programming assignments and in-person lab assignments.

Late/Missing Submissions:
======================================================================================
* A late assignment will be deducted 10% for every day the assignment is late. For instance, an assignment that is 2 days late and graded out of 100 points will be awarded a maximum of 80 points.
* The lowest assignment and quiz will be dropped.

Extensions:
======================================================================================
As a general rule, extensions will almost never be granted. Instead, the lowest assignment and quiz will be dropped. Extensions on course work will only be granted due to illness or similar **extraordinary** circumstances. In such a case, a note signed by a physician stating the date and time of the visit to the doctor’s office may be required. Any late work cannot be accepted three weeks after the end of term for any reason.

Missed Tests:
======================================================================================
Only medical reasons justify make-up exams. In the case of the final exam, as per existing policy, the student must get in touch with the instructor within 48 hours of the missed final.

Grading Scale:
======================================================================================

    Letter Grade | Numerical Equivalent | Grade Point | Grasp of Subject Matter | Other qualities expected of students
   --------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------0
    **A range:**                        | Excellent: Student shows original thinking, analytic and synthetic ability, critical evaluations, broad knowledge base.
    A+           |90-100                |4.33         | Extraordinary           | Strong evidence of original thought, of analytic and synthetic ability. Superior grasp of subject matter with sound and penetrating critical evaluations, which identify assumptions of those they study as well as their own; ; mastery of an extensive knowledge base.
    A            |85-89                  |4.0         | Excellent                  | Clear evidence of original thinking, of analytic and synthetic ability; Strong grasp of subject matter with sound critical evaluations; evidence of broad knowledge base.
    A-           |80-84                  |3.67        | Very, very good           | Strong grasp of subject matter and sound critical assessments with appreciation for the larger context.
    **B range:**                        | Good: Student shows critical capacity and analytic ability, understanding of relevant issues, familiarity with the literature.
    B+           |76-79                  |3.33        | Very good           | Good critical capacity and analytic ability; reasonable understanding of relevant issues; good evidence of
familiarity with literature.
